Sweat is the common thread that ties every fitness journey together, pushing us toward our goals. The pH level of sweat, a crucial factor in this shared experience, is 6.3, and it’s this very essence that inspired our name. Six Point Three stands as a symbol of the unity and determination that sweat represents in our collective pursuit of health and fitness.
